description: "Run tests and fix any failures"
---

1. Run the test suite: `pnpm test` (or equivalent command)
2. If all tests pass, report success
3. If any tests fail:
   - Analyze each failure
   - Determine if the test or implementation is wrong
   - Fix the issue
   - Re-run tests
   - Repeat until all tests pass

Be methodical: fix one test at a time and verify before moving to the next.
