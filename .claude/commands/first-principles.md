description: "Apply first-principles thinking to the problem"
---

When you encounter a problem where:
- Conventional solutions feel wrong
- Costs seem fixed
- You hear "that's how it's done"

Apply first-principles thinking:

1. **Identify the fundamental truths** - What are the absolute constraints that cannot be changed?
2. **Question every assumption** - Why do we do it this way? Is there a better way?
3. **Break down the problem** - What are the core components?
4. **Rebuild from scratch** - Design a solution based only on the fundamentals
5. **Validate against reality** - Does this solution actually work?

Don't accept "best practices" blindly. Understand why they exist and whether they apply to your situation.
